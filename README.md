# RSA-Factoring-Challenge

This project is an optional challenge that involves factorizing numbers obtained from an unsecured network. The goal is to break the encryption used on important documents by factorizing the numbers into their prime factors. The challenge is to complete the factorization as quickly as possible before the target fixes the encryption bug on their server.

##Background Context
Imagine you have sniffed an unsecured network and discovered numbers used for encrypting crucial documents. It appears that these numbers are not always generated using large enough prime numbers. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to factorize these numbers efficiently to decode the encrypted documents.

##Why RSA?
RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm widely used for secure data transmission. It relies on the mathematical difficulty of prime factorization to ensure the security of encrypted information. By breaking the encryption through factorization, we can decrypt the documents and access their contents.

##Requirements
Choose a programming language of your choice.
Set up the development environment on a Standard Ubuntu 20.04 LTS/ operating system.
Understand the RSA algorithm and its principles, including prime factorization.
Implement a function to generate an RSA key pair (public and private keys).
Implement functions for encryption and decryption using the RSA algorithm.
Implement a prime factorization algorithm to factorize the numbers obtained from the unsecured network.
Test the implementation with various inputs and optimize the factorization algorithm for faster results.
Submit your solution before the project deadline.
